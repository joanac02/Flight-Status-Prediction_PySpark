# Flight-Status-Prediction_PySpark
 
* In this study, the aim is to implement a model that classifies flights as likely to depart with or without delay based on a historical record. The database used is restricted to the United States of America between 2018 and 2023 and has more than 20 million records. Due to the size of the data used, the functionalities provided by the Apache Spark platform and the Python programming language will be used.

* The implementation of the solution is modular, using six notebooks that work sequentially but independently. Different Machine Learning classification models are trained and tested.

* The problem can be formalized as a binary classification task, where the aim is to classify whether a flight will depart late (positive class) or not (negative class).
